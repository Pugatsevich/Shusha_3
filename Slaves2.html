            <h2 class="title">The main slave</h2>
            <p>
              She worries me the most, she obeys my will, she is executive, but
              she often interferes in other people's business. She constantly
              wants something from me.

            <h2 class="title">Experienced</h2>
            <p>
              Seems normal, but doesn't show it yet. Regularly fulfills his
              duties, is efficient.

            <h2 class="title">Seems adequate</h2>
            <p>
              I haven't figured him out completely, but I think I can trust him.
              He cleans up poop, and wasn't upset when I took a crap on his
              couch.

            <h2 class="title">Better do not to make direct contact.</h2>
            <p>
              She is executive, looks like an ordinary slave, but is mannered
              and it is better not to conflict with her!
